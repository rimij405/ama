# rimij405/ama

A repository to ask [@rimij405](https://twitter.com/rimij405) anything.

I am currently a first year undergraduate at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu) and I'm a Game Design and Development major.
Although I am a Game Design major I've taken a fancy for web development.

I'm not *that* experienced, but, I'm always willing to learn more.

This AMA was forked from [@holman](https://github.com/holman/ama). Check their repo out and fork it if you want to make your own!

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/rimij405/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/rimij405/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
